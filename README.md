# BEAR_ADTS
The BEAR (Bayesian Experimental Autonomous Researcher) code used during the Autonomous Discover of Tough Structure Campaign.

This code is provided as a snapshot of the code as it existed at when the research paper Autonomous Discovery of Tough Structures was published. The paper is currently submitted and in review, but a preprint can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02315

This code is provided as insight into how the BEAR functions. However, because much of the functionality is specific to the hardware that we use, it is unlikely to be used by others as is. Rather, we hope that sharing this code will provide insight into how to set up a self-driving lab and provide examples of specific techniques for interface (serial port reading of scale, octocmd to control 3D printers, etc). 

If you have any questions about this code, please feel free to reach out to Kelsey Snapp at ksnapp@bu.edu
